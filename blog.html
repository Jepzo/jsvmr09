            <p>Today I added robots.txt to my site. This way I can hide my contact
              page from the search engines. Works great! Otherwise I have no
              reason to hide anything on my page so that is searchable from
              search engines. If you didn't know, robots.txt is used to decide
              what search engines get access to on my site. </p>

            <p>Stay calm, I havn't added any humans to my collection...<br>
              All I did was to add the humans.txt to my site as a way to get
              credit for developing this great site! It shows that I made the
              site. </p>

            <p>Finally! I added a picture so that when you share my beautiful
              site on facebook it will show a little picture that tells the
              receiver that this site is about me. Open graph gives the
              receiver a preview of the site or a picture so that he or she
              can get a hold of what the site contains. </p>

              <h2>Christmas!</h2>
              <p>2018-12-24</p>
            </header>
            <p>So I'm sitting here on christmas eve. The kids have gone to sleep
              and what better to do than write a little blog post for you guys?
              <br> For example I could tell you all about css and html. I learned
              a lot allready! But that would ber kind of boring right? <br> Okey
              So i'll just tell you why it is important to separate the css and
              html. The css is used for the design and layout of a web page.
              You do want this to be consistent on your site so what you do is:
              Make a separate file for the css and import it to your html code.
              That's really not so hard! And you do not have to rewrite your
              layout for every page on your web site. Works great don't you
              think? </p>
